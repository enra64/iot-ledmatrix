Custom scripts
==============

Custom scripts are what makes iot-ledmatrix powerful.
You can add any gimmick you want by adding an implementation to one of the subfolders of `scripts`.

Scripts beginning with ``_`` will not be displayed in the app to be manually loaded. Only a custom fragment can load them,
because they can only run properly with that custom fragment. Scripts *not* beginning with ``_`` can be loaded by the
user in a default fragment that lists them.
Other than that, new custom scripts do not need any configuration effort.

When your new script is requested in the app, it will be loaded and can draw to the led matrix.

How to draw from within the script
----------------------------------
Drawing to the matrix is done by using the functions of the canvas supplied with the draw calls. Detailed
documentation is available here: :ref:`canvas_class_label`

Creating a new script
---------------------

Custom scripts must contain a class that is exactly the name of the source file minus the `.py`.

For example, if you create a "flashlight" script, the file name would be ``flashlight.py``, and the class name would be ``flashlight``.

The class must inherit from CustomScript, which is documented here:

CustomScript class
------------------

.. automodule:: CustomScript
.. autoclass:: CustomScript.CustomScript
